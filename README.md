Doggo is a mobile application that helps dog owners effortlessly monitor and manage their pet's health, activity, and well-being. Doggo empowers the owners to stay connected with their furry friends like never before. Whether you're tracking your dog's daily exercise, planning outdoor adventures with GPS mapping, or scheduling important vet appointments. Doggo provides feedback, motivation, and rewards to dogs for their fitness activities and achievements.

Doggo comes with a compact attachment that easily fits onto your dog's collar or harness, tracking their activity and seamlessly communicating with the mobile app.
